# pygame-medic-snake
This is a common pygame testing the snake game concept where the player maneuvers a line that grows in length.

About this game:
This game is created with python3 and pygame, time and random python packages

The story of the game: 
The human body was infested with a very threatening virus for its life. The body fights all cells against this virus. 
The virus has a high infestation rate. He appears randomly for unknown reasons. 
Although the body fights in close detection another winner intervenes. 
He is the specialist in medicine who intervenes with pills to destroy the virus.

I made this game because I had a broken tooth and now I haven't found a dentist for the holidays. 
Until I get the pain or I get to the dentist I started writing this game.

This game comes with three players:
- a human player can change the pills with the arrows keys;
- a computer player follow the virus player;
- a threatening virus player with a random position;
